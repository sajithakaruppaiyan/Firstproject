    <p>Fashion is like dressing in a way that makes you happy and confident. It is about wearing different clothes, shoes, and accessories that you like. Sometimes, fashion changes with every season. In summer, we wear cool, light clothes, and in winter, we wear warm, cozy clothes. Fashion can also be about colors. Some people like bright colors, while others like soft colors. You can also express yourself through fashion. For example, if you love animals, you might wear a shirt with a picture of your favorite animal. So, fashion is a fun way to show your style.
